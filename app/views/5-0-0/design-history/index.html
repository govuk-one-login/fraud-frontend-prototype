      <p>This is the design story for the Shared Signals UI prototype {% include('../includes/version.html') %}.</p>

      {% include('../includes/summary.html') %}

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">MVP+ View</h2>
      <p>We've drafted an initial MVP journey based on early user insights, requirements and constraints. We will continue to test this as well as post MVP functioanlity that is emerging from user needs. The MVP functioanlity stays true to the strategic automated solution, allowing user to download (receive) and add (transmit) fraud shared signals.</p>
