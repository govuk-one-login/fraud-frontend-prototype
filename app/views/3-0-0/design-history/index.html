      <p>This is the design story for the Shared Signals UI prototype {% include('../includes/version.html') %}.</p>
         
      <p>This iteration contains some significant changes, based on early insight from internal users. The main features of this initial prototype include:</p>
      {% include('../includes/summary.html') %}

  

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Removed download journey</h2>
      <p>Users mentioned wanting to view the information before downloading. The call to action to download seemed redundanct and added to the cognitive load on the task screen.</p>
      <p>One user mentioned wanting to see a "homepage" showing links to past submissions. We will wait to see if a pattern emmerges around this need.</p>
      <p><a href="../task">View updated task screen</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Added sort and filter to view screens</h2>
      <p>Users wanted to get to the list page sooner and some users mentioned being user led, so seeing lists and filters on previous screens was jarring.</p>
        <p>Filters and sortable tables were implemented, however for reseaerch we may look to add one interactive element at a time. In addition we have renamed Intervention with status and can make use of the GDS tags pattern, but will first do some research to see if that is needed  and some card sorting to understand how colours land with users. <a href="../view-information">View information lists with filters</a>.</p>
        <p>A <a href="../get-reasons">javascript disable approach</a> was also maintained.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Added ID details view</h2>
      <p>Users expected to see more information than what was on the list page. Some audit history and a chronological view of the data was mentioned. 
        The priority of the information is to be explored in the next round of research. 
        More info <a href="../view-information-detail">here</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Iterated upload journey with additional optional field</h2>
      <p>More info <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Iterated upload journey with updated event names</h2>
      <p>More info <a href="../add-reason">here</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">MoJ frontend and Jquery added</h2>
      <p>MoJ frontend and Jquery were added to the prototype to allow for filtering and sorting</p>
