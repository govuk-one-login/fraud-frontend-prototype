      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Iterated content for Start, Login and Task page</h2>
      <p>This version saw some considerable changes, due to some great work by a Content Designer who recently joined the team.

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Iterated content for download journey</h2>
        <p>The content work also covered the <a href="../get-reasons?release-state=MVP">download journey</a>.</p>

      
        <p>An initial rewording of the Service name was introduce, however a full workshop will be needed.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Added help links</h2>
      <p>Content was added on all screens to provide users a channel for support.</p>
      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Removed stand alone support page</h2>
      <p>Due to the MVP approach to support channels, the need to a stand alone support screen was reviewed, and instead a link to a shared email address was added.</p>
