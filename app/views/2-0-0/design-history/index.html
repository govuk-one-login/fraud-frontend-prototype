      <!-- <p>This is the first design story for the Shared Signals UI prototype.</p>
      <p>The main features of this initial prototype include:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Upload information</li>
        <li>View previous uploaded information</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Upload information</h2>
      <p>Initial upload functionality includes <a href="../upload-file">upload by file</a>,one by one <a href="../reason">by a form</a>.</p>
      <p>Check you answers patterns are used and vary if the user uploads by file or by form.</p>
      <p><a href="../cya?file-upload=true">CYA after file upload</a> | <a href="../cya?id-multiple=yes&file-upload=false">CYA after form</a></p>
      

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">View previous uploaded information</h2>
      <p>This initial prototype covers the unhappy path of showing unsuccessful submissions. This is handled with a <a href="../view-submission-history">list of submissions</a> and links to view submission details.</p>
      <p>There is a <a href="../view-failed-submission-lite">lite version</a> and a more <a href="../view-failed-submission">detailed approach</a>.</p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Areas to look at next</h2>
      <p>Look to iterate the upload functionality after usability testing, and understanding of impact wider discussions.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Issues flagged</h2>
      <p>Due to the complexity of the language used to describe RISC events, I've flagged there could be a need for a Content Designer, or Technical Writer.</p>
      <p>Other design activities for a content designer would be to input in the flow and hierachy of the journey and naming of the sservice.</p>
      <p>Also we are still understanding the RP requirements, so initially the designs that we will be testing, are focused on the core functionality - initially Uploading information and Downloading information.</p> -->
